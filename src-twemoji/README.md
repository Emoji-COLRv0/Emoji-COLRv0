The SVG graphics in this folder come from the [Twemoji project by Twitter](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji), and are licensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
This means that you can freely reuse these graphics as long as you proper credit to the Twemoji Project

Twemoji in particular is fairly lax about what constitutes proper attribution, stating in the project's README that: 

> As an open source project, attribution is critical from a legal, practical and motivational perspective in our opinion. The graphics are licensed under the CC-BY 4.0 which has [a pretty good guide on best practices for attribution](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Best_practices_for_attribution).  
> 
> However, we consider the guide a bit onerous and as a project, will accept a mention in a project README or an 'About' section or footer on a website. In mobile applications, a common place would be in the Settings/About section (for example, see the mobile Twitter application Settings->About->Legal section). We would consider a mention in the HTML/JS source sufficient also.

The zip of SVG files is simply a compressed copy of the [svg folder from Twemoji's asset directory](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji/tree/master/assets/svg). 
Due to the consistent flat style and clean code of Twemoji, I didn't have to modify any images to make them work with nanoemoji.

Please note that this font project is not officially affliated with the Twemoji project.
