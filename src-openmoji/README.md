[OpenMoji](https://openmoji.org/) is an emoji set designed primarily by students and staff at the Schwäbisch Gmünd University of Design. The images are used under the [CC BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license. 

I have made several modifications to the source svg files used in building this font. These changes, which you can view [here](https://github.com/Emoji-COLRv0/openmoji/commits/master), merely consist of removing some duplicate id attributes from some of the SVG files.

Also, thank you to contributor *mavit* for [demonstrating how to compile COLRv0 fonts using nanoemoji](https://github.com/hfg-gmuend/openmoji/pull/260).

Below, I have reproduced the License and Atrtibution requirements from the [OpenMoji Github repo](https://github.com/hfg-gmuend/openmoji):
