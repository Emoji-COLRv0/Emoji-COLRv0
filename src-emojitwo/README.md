The SVG files in this folder are licensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode). 
They come from the [EmojiTwo project](https://github.com/EmojiTwo/emojitwo), which is a fork of a project called EmojiOne.
EmojiOne's original publisher also has a closed-source successor to EmojiOne called [Joypixels](https://github.com/joypixels).

I have modified several of these SVG files to work with Google's nanoemoji font builder.
[The changes I have made can be viewed here.](https://github.com/Emoji-COLRv0/emojitwo/commits/master)
None of these changes meaningfully alter the artistic content content of the files, and so all credit should still go to Joypixels and the EmojiTwo Project.

This font project is not officially affliated with either Joypixels nor the EmojiTwo project.

### Emojione Artwork Attribution

With the release of version 3.0, the Emojione project also made changes to 2.2.7â€™s licensing. 
[Previously](https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20170327003706/http://emojione.com/licensing/#attribution), Emojione did not require attribution for non-commercial and personal use. Considering that the Emojione project only changed the documentation in that branch to mandate attribution in any case, Emojitwo forked a state before those changes for greater flexibility.

For **non-commercial** and **personal use**, you *should* credit the creators. 
For **commercial use**, proper attribution *must* be given on every web page, app, or video description where our emojis are displayed. 

### Creative Commons Requirements

In section 3(a)(1) of the CC-BY 4.0 legal terms, it lists the following as the guidelines needed to fulfill the attribution requirements:

> - retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:
>     - identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);

> - indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
> - indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License."
