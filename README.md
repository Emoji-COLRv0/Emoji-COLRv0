## How do I build the fonts?

On MacOS or Linux:

1. Clone this repo.
2. Navigate to the repo's folder in a command line.
3. Create a [python virtual environment](python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment) with `python3 -m venv colrvenv`, where 'colrvenv' can be substituted for whatever you want the path to the virtual environment to be.
4. Activate the virtual environment with `source colrvenv/bin/activate`
5. Install [my fork](https://github.com/Emoji-COLRv0/nanoemoji) of Google's nanoemoji tool into the virtual environment with `pip install git+https://github.com/Emoji-COLRv0/nanoemoji.git`

The next step depends on which font you want to build.
